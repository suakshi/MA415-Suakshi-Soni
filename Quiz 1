## q1
C. std should be sd
This is because the rnorm() function uses the sd argument for standard deviation, not std.

##q2
A. type = "lines" should be type = "l"
This is beacuse the type argument in plot() should use "l" to indicate lines. "lines" is not valid.

##q3
A. Creates a scatter plot with red points of a specific shape
This is because col = "red" colors the points, and pch = 16 specifies a filled circle shape.

##q4
B. cbind()
This is because cbind() binds objects by columns; rbind() binds by rows.

##q5
A. geom_point() creates scatter plots, while geom_line() connects points with lines

##q6
set.seed(123)
x1 <- rnorm(100, mean = 5, sd = 2)

set.seed(123)
x2 <- rnorm(100, mean = 5, sd = 2)
